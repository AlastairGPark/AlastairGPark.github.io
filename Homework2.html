            start, ending with a super fight between the 155 pound <sup> (Lightweight) </sup>and the 145 pound<sup> (Featherweight)</sup>
            champions. As well as an intirim title fight. Alexander Volkanovski has this to say about his upcoming fight:</p>
            <blockquote>"I think going for this champ-champ and taking out someone like Islam is really what people are going to sort of remember. 
                Again, a lot of people think he's unstoppable right now, but I'm gonna show you that he is stoppable. I can't wait to go out there and do my thing."</blockquote>
